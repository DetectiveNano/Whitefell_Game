dont fuck with the code.
please dont fuck with the code
its beneficial to everyone that you dont fuck with the code
i know there are problems with the code
im fixing those problems

the only commands the game accepts rn are the inputs it asks for
"city" , "village", and "stop"
enter "stop" when youre ready to stop traveling bc rn all you can do is travel

if you find a problem contact me at LightKilt#6223 on discord

the game is very specific with file names and inputs, please dont fuck stuff up and get upset,
i havent made the game mistake/dumbass proof yet

also dont mess with your save files, you might think you could get away with changing a few values but i did some testing and it fucks everything up, so do it at your own risk.
